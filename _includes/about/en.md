> This is a good world.


Hi, I am Cheng Qian, a full stack software engineer. I am now a master candidate of [University of California, San diego](https://ucsd.edu/), majored in Electricl and Computer Engineering. I previously worked as QA Engineer at [Baidu](http://www.baidu.com/), Platform Test Team.

I studied Telecommunication Engineering and graduated from the joint programm between [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://www.bupt.edu.cn/) and [Queen Mary, University of London](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/)by 2016 with the first class honored bachelor degree.

Proud to be a geek. I prefer to be called as an engineer more than a programmer. Languages are my swords and algorithms and design are my soul. From the former experience in one of Chinese biggest Internet companies, I also got a sharp sense towards product. But more importantly, what motivate me everyday is the huge enthusiasm towards code and engineering.

“Make the world a better place because of you.” This is exactly the meaningful life for which I strive—purposeful, adventurous, and fulfilling as well.
